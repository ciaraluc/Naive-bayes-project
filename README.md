Our project will look at reviews of a specific product and be able to write a review for that product.

We used a data set from kaggle that contained reviews of iphone 11's from amazon. We planned to use the Bayes classifier to give each a probability of being positive or negative. This would be done by testing the frequency of each word in all the positive reviews compared to its frequency in the negatives.
