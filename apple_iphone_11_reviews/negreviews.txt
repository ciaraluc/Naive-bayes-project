Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees."So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereâ€™s a glitch in the front cameraâ€™s portrait mode. Thatâ€™s fine, it may happen. But whatâ€™s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!"I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone onlineThe phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone.

I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating."STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!!It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime onlyIm facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrentyI had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues.

Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product."Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached)"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market."This Appario seem to be a fraud.

Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone."iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious.

Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies arenâ€™t good at all. You canâ€™t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records thatâ€™s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. Thereâ€™s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phoneâ€™s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe itâ€™s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnâ€™t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still donâ€™t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. Itâ€™s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didnâ€™t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price"I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !""Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn't even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product.""I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don't know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK."Pls pls don't buy from amazon or any other site buy it from store because i got a defected xr its face id is not working and it is having heating issues and now amazon is also not replacing it"It is very sad to say that Amazone allow to seller to sell the Damage iPhone to their site,.I purchase iphone XR but after receiving it is found that speaker was not good,vibration problem and camera quality was bad.I contacted to Amazone customer care but they refuse to do the same.â€ù, Amazone customer told  that everything ll be look by iPhone care.I went there and they told me to submit the phone.They r not Exchanging  the same.Its been feel like I m using 2nd hand phone.Really very disappointed."It is genuine and good phone. Esim facility is not working. May have to check with the service provider as well."Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all.""Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders.""I don't like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It's battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don't find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before.""What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once."Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working.3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help donâ€™t have a clue where to go for helpThis rating is not for the product.... Its for the seller... Who has delivered the product with scratches on the back panel.....The phone is definitely not performing per iPhone standards - frequent Call drops ( the issue is not with network provider ) and battery life is worse than iPhone 8."While I started using this phone, I realized that my takes much longer time to get charged. However, other phones I have get charged quickly from their respective cables. I am unsure about the originality of the product received."Not a value for money product.Apple is still giving 1amp charger with such expensive phone with almost 3000 mAh battery. The same charger is also  given along with 5s and also SE.Heating so fast in use after 15 minute of useIn camera video and slow mo is not working properly and I havenâ€™t received any bill neither hard copy nor soft"If you are buying just because of the brand name then go for it, else it's of no use."automatically restart some timesThe phone freezes frequently. Battery doesnâ€™t last long. On the whole I am very disappointed with the  phone. Did not expect this from Apple.The most unique feature of this product - face id for unlock is not working in the product delivered to me. Now i have to keep visiting the apple service centre to get it fixed.I received the product with hair line scratch on the screen which does not appear at a glance but upon reflection of light on a specific angle it appears.  During delivery I could not detect it but after few days I recognized. From Apple I do not expect any cheating on product qualityWhen I switched on it started getting heated up near camera.  Mix of gold and yellow is bit ugly. My other side of speaker isnâ€™t working. Selfie portrait is good rest is not much appreciable.Everthing about this phone is good except the back glass which is not durable.the backglass shattered into  pieces from simple fall in the car and apple asking to phone for whopping 53000 to change thephone my phone is just 20 days oldDoes not support dual physical sim . Screen size is smaller. Does not allow google . All downloads are paid downloads.  All songs storage is through I tunes application which also comes at a cost. Lot of drawbacks for a normal user and not user friendly."Earlier i was having Apple Product which i bought it from Dubai, and now i am using XR which i bought it online, and this really sucks. The earphone quality is not the one apple used to have, Zero Noise Cancellation, zero Quality."Mobile has some defect. Gets struck some time.The phone is amazing but i got cheated as i was promised the EMI of 4040 per month for 12 months. The sum of rs 4275 got deducted from my account. This is seriously not fare as i m paying almost 1500 rs more for my phone.I am not satisfied.Colour is totally different. Don't go with the looks in Amazon website.This liquid retina high quality display doesn't beat my Samsung A8. Very disappointed. Sold in 2day.I purchased this iPhone XR I think the same is refurbished item which I received.The phone is not good as normal I phones . Always hang. Face recognition always give problems . And if you go service Center they say take backups and come backGood product. Bad battery lifeProduct received Manufacturers damage display and back panel gap and back panel damage receivedLeft speaker is not workingThe phone is a bit slow while switching data plans between the two connected sim.Purchased the new iPhone XR on 21 July.Not sure battery is not at all good. Disappointed with amazo and apple both.please help me out with the exchange or refund .After one month of buying the phone it got hung up which never happens with i phone want a immediate replacementProduct not a good price as well as not desire range of qualityAwesom"Speed quality of internet etc is disappointing  compare to similar kind of Samsung phone. Otherwise phone is good , Never hang""The phone is working properly but the headphones are not working. For a new device, itâ€™s pretty surprising to see such a state. Not happy with the item"Mobile device is not upto the markA disgrace. Camera has become awful and the pictures clicked donâ€™t look real. Looks like a filter is by default on.The product is not so good some time hanged and some time not working properly the product performance is so badly till nowFirst tym m very disappointed from I phone ...I didnt hear the sound properly"The charger adapter was damaged within one month of use,I am very disappointed, I didnâ€™t expected this from this kind of product."Overall was super but little little problemi got my charger Defected. I would recommend to buy from store not online. Touch is also not good.It doesnâ€™t recognise the face properly. Battery life is good. Camera also not very good."The phone got delivered today, when I opened it, there is a little scratch on the phone already."It user friendlinessThis is not genuine product. It have so many problem especially hanging problemVoice problemApple need to invent new designVery poor mobile for Android mobile"Will not recommend anyone to buy this product, not worth of money."Front camera is not so good it's not clear  and phone weight is not lightMy touch system not within three weeks after I bought the item.Voice not clear in callsCharger is broken.. There is no warranty details for the same.Battery life pathetic....I did not 1 year warrenty card...provide thisThe product starts restarting every time has to giv it to service centreFULLFILEED NOT BOX AS THERE DESCRIBE IN PRODUCTIt got stuck in the beginningRing tone is very very low since few days ?Its not at all satisfying.Price have been dropped in one day kindly refundAwesome product and smooth process.Heating issue while chargingI dislike this phoneNot received invoice soft copyI'm not sureBattery  Backup is in faultCharger is not workingTouch pad is too slowSpeaker is causing problemPhone is superbCharger issue
